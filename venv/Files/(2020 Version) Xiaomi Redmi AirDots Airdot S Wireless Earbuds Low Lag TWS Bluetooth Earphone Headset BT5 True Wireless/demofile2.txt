Product Description
The Redmi Earbuds S, also known as the Redmi AirDots S, are a pair of affordable truly wireless earphones by Xiaomi. Despite the pricing, the company markets these as full-featured wireless earphones with an attractive, lightweight design, 12 hour battery life, splash-resistance, and a dedicated low-latency gaming mode.
Design
The Redmi Earbuds S have what has now become a very common design for truly wireless earphones. You get the classic in-ear style design along with a case that also charges the earbuds.
The Redmi Earbuds S come in a rather small and good-looking case. It's tall, so it won't fit inside the coin pocket in your jeans, but the overall volume of the case is quite low so it won't take up a lot of space inside your main pocket or bag.
The case is really light, especially with no earphones inside them. The overall build quality is quite decent for the price. The lid opens and closes with a reasonably well-weighted mechanism and shuts tight with only a little bit of play.
The earbuds have the same matte finish as the case. They have a pill-shaped design that fits the cavity of your outer ear quite nicely, although your mileage may vary. There's also an LED on each that's hidden away and glows to alert you of charging or pairing status.
Comfort
The Redmi Earbuds S are a reasonably comfortable pair of earphones. The earphones come with three different ear tip sizes, all of which are made out of rubber. The default size fits me perfectly and the earphones sit comfortably in my ears without feeling like they would fall out. This is important as they do not have any other appendage to keep them in like some of the sporty models.
Battery Life
The Redmi Earbuds S have a claimed battery life of 4 hours when used continuously and 12 hours when combined with all the juice inside the case.$25.90
